Installation
============

Pint has no dependencies except Python_ itself. In runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

You can install it (or upgrade to the latest version) using pip_::

    $ pip install -U pint

That's all! You can check that Pint is correctly installed by starting up python, and importing pint:

.. testcode::

    >>> import pint             # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> pint.__version__        # doctest: +SKIP

.. note:: If you have an old system installation of Python and you don't want to
   mess with it, you can try `Anaconda CE`_. It is a free Python distribution by
   Continuum Analytics that includes many scientific packages. To install pint
   from the conda-forge channel instead of through pip use:
       $ conda install -c conda-forge pint

You can check the installation with the following command:

    >>> pint.test()                 # doctest: +SKIP


On Arch Linux, you can alternatively install Pint from the Arch User Repository
(AUR). The latest release is available as `python-pint`_, and packages tracking
the master branch of the GitHub repository are available as `python-pint-git`_
and `python2-pint-git`_.


Getting the code
----------------

You can also get the code from PyPI_ or GitHub_. You can either clone the public repository::

    $ git clone git://github.com/hgrecco/pint.git

Download the tarball::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/tarball/master

Or, download the zipball::

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/zipball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package, or install it into your site-packages easily::
