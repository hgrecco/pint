Installation

Pint has no dependencies except Python_ itself. In runs on Python 2.7 and 3.0+.

You can install it using pip_::

That's all! You can check that Pint is correctly installed by starting up python, and importing pint:

   mess with it, you can try `Anaconda CE`_. It is a free Python distribution by
   Continuum Analytics that includes many scientific packages.

On Arch Linux, you can alternatively install Pint from the Arch User Repository
(AUR). The latest release is available as `python-pint`_, and packages tracking
the master branch of the GitHub repository are available as `python-pint-git`_
and `python2-pint-git`_.
