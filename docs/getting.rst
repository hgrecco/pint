Getting Pint
============

Pint has no dependencies except Python_ itself. In runs on Python 2.7+ and 3.0+.

You can install it using pip_::

or you can also install by downloading the source code in PyPi_ and then running::

    $ python setup.py install

That's all! You can check that Pint is correctly installed by starting up python, and importing pint:

.. note:: If you have an old system installation of Python and you don't want to
   mess with it, you can try `Anaconda CE`_. It is a free Python distribution by
   Continuum Analytics that includes many scientific packages.
