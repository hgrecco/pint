0.13 (2020-06-17)
-----------------

  (Issue #1036, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- Fixed bug with multiplication of Quantity by dict (Issue #1032)
- Bare zeros and NaNs (not wrapped by Quantity) are now gracefully accepted by all numpy
  operations; e.g. np.stack([Quantity([1, 2], "m"), [0, np.nan]) is now valid, whereas
  np.stack([Quantity([1, 2], "m"), [3, 4]) will continue raising DimensionalityError.
  (Issue #1050, Thanks Guido Imperiale)

  The old implementation treated 'Lx' as 'S' as produced by 'uncertainties'
  package, but that is not fully compatible with SIunitx. The new code protects
  SIunitx by fixing what unceratinties produces.
  (Issue #814)
- Added link to budding `pint-xarray` interface library to the docs, next to
  the link to pint-pandas. (Thanks Tom Nicholas.)
- Removed outdated `_dir` attribute of `UnitsRegistry`, and added `__iter__`
  method so that now `list(ureg)` returns a list of all units in registry.
  (Issue #1072, Thanks Tom Nicholas)
- Replace pkg_resources.version to importlib.metadata.version. (Issue #1083)
- Fix typo in docs for wraps example with optional arguments. (Issue #1088)

  (Issue #1112, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- Added support for checking prefixed units using `in` keyword (Issue #1086)
- Updated many examples in the documentation to reflect Pint's current behavior


0.12 (2020-05-29)
-----------------

- Add full support for Decimal and Fraction at the registry level.
  **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  `use_decimal` is deprecated. Use `non_int_type=Decimal` when instantiating
  the registry.
- Fixed bug where numpy.pad didn't work without specifying constant_values or
  end_values (Issue #1026)


0.11 (2020-02-19)
-----------------

- Added pint-convert script.
- Remove `default_en_0.6.txt`.
- Make `__str__` and `__format__` locale configurable.
  (Issue #984)
- Quantities wrapping NumPy arrays will no longer warning for the changed
  array function behavior introduced in 0.10.
  (Issue #1029, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  The array protocol fallback deprecated in version 0.10 has been removed.
  (Issue #1029, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Now we use `pyproject.toml` for providing `setuptools_scm` settings
- Remove `default_en_0.6.txt`
- Reorganize long_description.
- Moved Pi to definitions files.
- Use ints (not floats) a defaults at many points in the codebase as in Python 3
  the true division is the default one.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Added `from_string` method to all Definitions subclasses. The value/converter
  argument of the constructor no longer accepts an string.
  It is unlikely that this change affects the end user.
- Added additional NumPy function implementations (allclose, intersect1d)
  (Issue #979, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Allow constants in units by using a leading underscore (Issue #989, Thanks
  Juan Nunez-Iglesias)
- Fixed bug where to_compact handled prefix units incorrectly (Issue #960)


0.10.1 (2020-01-07)
-------------------

  from NumPy arrays by multiplication.
  (Issue #977, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Fixed several Sphinx issues. Fixed intersphinx hooks to all classes missing.
  (Issue #881, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- Fixed __array__ signature to match numpy docs (Issue #974, Thanks Ryan May)


0.10 (2020-01-05)
-----------------

- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Boolean value of Quantities with offsets units is ambiguous, and so, now a ValueError
  is raised when attempting to cast such a Quantity to boolean.
  (Issue #965, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  `__array_ufunc__` has been implemented on `pint.Unit` to permit
  multiplication/division by units on the right of ufunc-reliant array types (like
  Sparse) with proper respect for the type casting hierarchy. However, until [an
  upstream issue with NumPy is resolved](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15200),
  this breaks creation of Masked Array Quantities by multiplication on the right.
  Read Pint's [NumPy support
  documentation](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html) for more details.
  (Issues #963 and #966, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Documentation on Pint's array type compatibility has been added to the NumPy support
  page, including a graph of the duck array type casting hierarchy as understood by Pint
  for N-dimensional arrays.
  (Issue #963, Thanks Jon Thielen, Stephan Hoyer, and Guido Imperiale)
- Improved compatibility for downcast duck array types like Sparse.COO. A collection
  of basic tests has been added.
  (Issue #963, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Improvements to wraps and check:

  - fail upon decoration (not execution) by checking wrapped function signature against
    wraps/check arguments.
    (might BREAK test code)
  - wraps only accepts strings and Units (not quantities) to avoid confusion with magnitude.
    (might BREAK code not conforming to documentation)
  - when strict=True, strings that can be parsed to quantities are accepted as arguments.

- Add revolutions per second (rps)
- Improved compatibility for upcast types like xarray's DataArray or Dataset, to which
  Pint Quantities now fully defer for arithmetic and NumPy operations. A collection of
  basic tests for proper deferral has been added (for full integration tests, see
  xarray's test suite). The list of upcast types is available at
  `pint.compat.upcast_types` in the API.
  (Issue #959, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Moved docstrings to Numpy Docs
  (Issue #958)
- Added tests for immutability of the magnitude's type under common operations
  (Issue #957, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Switched test configuration to pytest and added tests of Pint's matplotlib support.
  (Issue #954, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Deprecate array protocol fallback except where explicitly defined (`__array__`,
  `__array_priority__`, `__array_function__`, `__array_ufunc__`). The fallback will
  remain until the next minor version, or if the environment variable
  `PINT_ARRAY_PROTOCOL_FALLBACK` is set to 0.
  (Issue #953, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Removed eval usage when creating UnitDefinition and PrefixDefinition from string.
  (Issue #942)
- Added `fmt_locale` argument to registry.
  (Issue #904)
- Better error message when Babel is not installed.

  conversions. Read

  - https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html
  - https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/currencies.html

  (Issue #938, Thanks Guido Imperiale)

  (Issues #929, #931, and #937, Thanks Guido Imperiale)

  e.g. pip install git+https://github.com/hgrecco/pint.git.
  (Issues #930 and #934, Thanks Guido Imperiale and KOLANICH)
- Fix HTML (Jupyter Notebook) and LateX representation of some units
  (Issues #927 / #928 / #933, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- Fixed the definition of RKM unit as gf / tex
  (Issue #921, Thanks Giuseppe Corbelli)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Implement NEP-18 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html> for
  Pint Quantities. Most NumPy functions that previously stripped units when applied to
  Pint Quantities will now return Quantities with proper units (on NumPy v1.16 with
  the array_function protocol enabled or v1.17+ by default) instead of ndarrays. Any
  non-explictly-handled functions will now raise a "no implementation found" TypeError
  instead of stripping units. The previous behavior is maintained for NumPy < v1.16 and
  when the array_function protocol is disabled.
  (Issue #905, Thanks Jon Thielen and andrewgsavage)
- Implementation of NumPy ufuncs has been refactored to share common utilities with
  NumPy function implementations
  (Issue #905, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- Pint Quantities now support the `@` matrix mulitiplication operator (on NumPy v1.16+),
  as well as the `dot`, `flatten`, `astype`, and `item` methods.
  (Issue #905, Thanks Jon Thielen)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Fix crash when applying pprint to large sets of Units.
  DefinitionSyntaxError is now a subclass of SyntaxError (was ValueError).
  DimensionalityError and OffsetUnitCalculusError are now subclasses of TypeError (was
  ValueError).
  (Issue #915, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- All Exceptions can now be pickled and can be accessed from the top-level package.
  (Issue #915, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- Mark regex as raw strings to avoid unnecessary warnings.
  (Issue #913, Thanks keewis)
- Implement registry-based string preprocessing as list of callables.
  (Issues #429 and #851, thanks Jon Thielen)
- Context activation and deactivation is now instantaneous; drastically reduced memory
  footprint of a context (it used to be ~1.6MB per context; now it's a few bytes)
  (Issues #909 / #923 / #938, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
- **BREAKING CHANGE**:
  Drop support for Python < 3.6, numpy < 1.14, and uncertainties < 3.0;
  if you still need them, please install pint 0.9.
  Pint now adheres to NEP-29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>
  as a rolling dependencies version policy.
  (Issues #908 and #910, Thanks Guido Imperiale)
